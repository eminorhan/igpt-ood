# Probing the OOD behavior of Image GPT

The pretrained Image GPT models were kindly provided [here](https://github.com/openai/image-gpt) by Mark Chen. The code for porting these pretrained models to huggingface was borrowed from [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/apeguero1/image-gpt/blob/master/Transformers_Image_GPT.ipynb) kindly made available by Alfredo Peguero.
